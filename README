## Student Information

**Name:** Desmond Farley-Williams
**Student ID:** 008508702
**Repository:** https://github.com/3750449/Project-5----priority-queue-study_315_2025.git

---

## Collaboration & Sources
- Standard references (cppreference, GeeksforGeeks) for C++ lookups and examples

## Layout

- **Implementations:** Binary heap, Binomial queue, Linear baseline, Quadratic oracle (sanity / small N)
- **Trace profiles:** `batch_then_drain` (N inserts, then N delete/find ops)

- **Executables:**
  - `batch_then_drain_gen.exe` — generates `.trace` files
  - `harness.exe` — replays traces and prints CSV rows to **stdout**
  - `huffman_trace.exe` — (separate profile, optional)

**CSV header and rows** are emitted by `harness` on stdout

## Build (in CLion)

1. Open the root folder in CLion
2. Build targets: `batch_then_drain_gen`, `harness`

---

## Generate traces

The generator writes:
 .\cmake-build-debug\batch_then_drain_gen.exe

You should also see then ~55 files like:

traces\batch_then_drain\batch_then_drain_N_1024_S_101.trace
...
traces\batch_then_drain\batch_then_drain_N_1048576_S_505.trace

## Visualize

Open the local chart page and upload the CSV:

charts\pq_multi_impl_anchor_heap_tooltips.html

---

## Run the harness and capture CSV

The harness finds traces relative to its own location:

<harness.exe dir>\..\traces\batch_then_drain

(with CLion’s default build, that’s `<repo>\traces\batch_then_drain`)

## Visualize

Open the chart page and upload the CSV it asks for

* `charts/pq_multi_impl_anchor_heap_tooltips.html`
